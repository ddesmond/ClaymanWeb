### Rebuild Package

If the contents of the package change in the filesystem, you will want to update the package contents data.
Right clicking on the Selected item in the library view you can choose Rebuild Package action which will rebuild all the items found on the root level of the package itself.

This is very convinient if you plan to change the assets or number of asset items in the package itself.
