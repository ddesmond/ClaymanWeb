### Quixel Megascans Integration

Clayman can load and create linked asset packages from any Megascan Library.
Go to Integrations > QuixelSync and setup a path to the root folder of a Quixel Megascans library.
All download assets will be ingested as linked packages and behave like any other normal package.

After the ingesting process is done you will be able to use assets as any other in Clayman.
The ingesting process will take some time to finish, so be patient if you have a large library or a lots of 4K + textures in the downloaded Quixel assets.

Clarisse will load any Megascans asset trough the Clarisse Survival Kit.
