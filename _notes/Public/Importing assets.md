### Creating an Asset Package

To <b>Create a new package</b>, while in the Desktop application, simply drop your files over the Clayman application or press the **+** icon in the toolbar. This will trigger the Import popup window to appear over Clayman.

The most important part of the Importing process is to <b>correctly add information</b> about what you are actualy importing.

Setup what the package is about, is it a surface or pure geometry ? Lights setup? Project file? This declares what package is generaly about and that is how it is gona be interpereted in Clayman and kept in Library on your disk drive.

You can <b>Add items by droping more over the Importer UI</b>, you can remove items by selecting them red and presing the Remove button.
There is no restrictions on what files you can hold in the library. Any file can be imported.

Select an image to be the <b>Package thumbnail</b>, currently only JPG or PNG are supported in this step. Everything else will yield a extension icon or genereic data icon. Selecting JPG or PNG will trigger the Color extraction process on the selected thumbnail when the files are imported.

Best visual results have Thumbnails which actualy show whats in the package (color and content wise) 512x512 or 1024x1024. <b>Square format only supported. Everyhting else will get scaled to to fit 1:1 ratio.</b>

<b>Importing heavy filesize assets yields to longer importing times, since the copying of actual files is done in this step.
Wait until progress says 100% !</b>
