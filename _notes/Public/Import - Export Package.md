### Import - Export Package

Clayman has the ability to export a package as a zip file for further consuming, archiving, or sending to another library.

Selecting an asset and Choosing the Export action will ask you for a save location where the Archived packages will be held.

Importing an archived package is very easy, click on the Import package on the toolbar or CTRL+I and your archived package will be directly imported and unpacked into your Library folder.
