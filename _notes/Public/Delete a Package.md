**Windows users:**
Clayman currently has issues with Windows files open handles, so the packages will be partialy deleted - partialy moved to invalid files.
Linux and Mac users dont have this issues and deleting a package works without issues.

**To solve this issue, please delete the packages by hand (or leave Clayman to cleanup after itself on next application start)**
