### Package Context Plugins

Clayman has a package context aware plugin system which is loaded from the user folders plugins folder. This offers users to write package aware plugins which are shown on the mouse right click package selection (single item selection only).

Plugins are python scripts which have acces to Library API and data from the selected item is fuly exposed to the user to take advantage of.

This gives developers power to process a single item in many ways they could see fit either on Desktop or In-app.
Examples of such plugins would be a MakeTX script which would convert the pacakge images to tx. Sending packages data to external databases. Extracting package data for third party usage.
