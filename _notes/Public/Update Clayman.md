Updating Clayman to a new version is very simple!
Under the Hel Menu, click on Update Clayman.

The updater will open where you can check for updates.
If there is new version you will be able do download and install it automaticaly!
After the update close all windows and Start Clayman again.

If you see the Updater hanging and not downloading the updated files check your firewall settings that Clayman has access to https://www.clayman.app .

Clayman will always check for hashes on the updates before any update to be sure the files are correct.
