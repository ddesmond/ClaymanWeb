### Invalid Packages

Sometimes package can end up unreadable due to missing package.json or malformed data. On Clayman start, all packages are being checked and if error found the package is then moved to the Invalid packages folder in your Library.

In the menu select Show Invalid Packages to see what packages are not valid and check them by hand.

After fixing those you can move them by hand back to where they belong and try to reload Clayman with the Refresh CTRL+R or app restart.
